Features I Tried to Incorporate:
- Used redux and redux toolkit, plenty of use with useSelector and dispatch hooks
- Leveraged firebase Google authentication to be able to sign in with gmail
- Used material UI 
- Practice with firebase hooks; mainly for useAuthState, this was used to verify and authenticate the user being logged in
- Used react-spinkit on the login page for loading
- Lots of practice with ternary conditionals
